I was born in Mithi on 5th February 2010 when my family was residing in Bhorilo, a small town in the Chelhar tehsil of Tharparkar. I migrated to Mithi with my family when I was five and therefore went through my primary education in Mithi under the supervision of my parents. Mithi has nurtured me and provided me with the best possible education system in Sindh. I have to say that the institution has always proved its worth, and it was an honor to get the early schooling there.

I also stood qualified to sit the NJV School Scholarship Programme test after completing 8th grade, which enabled me to continue my post-primary education at NJV School in Karachi. This opened wider vistas of education for me, and infused in me a sense of independence and responsibility, hardly filled by the earlier schooling. The last two years at NJV have been transformative both academically and personally. A passion for programming, mathematics, and physics intensified during this time with great satisfaction in solving very complex problems in these fields.

I have seen diversity in culture with harmony because of the culture of Mithi. We are living peaceably in a bond of brotherhood in Hindus and Muslims, where we celebrate Holi, Diwali, Thadri, and Janmashtami with great enthusiasm. They have instilled within me the values of unity and shared joy, which I carry close to my heart.

This program will enable me to develop myself further and subsequently help my family in all these ways. Coming forward with such awe and great interest, I am highly confident with the decision and am now ready to await a chance to take on new experiences, cultures, and challenges. Through this program, I hope to enhance my skills and broaden my perspectives to pave ways to succeeding as a programmer and entrepreneur in the future.
